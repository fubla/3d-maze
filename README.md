# 3d maze 
## Description
My first 3d graphics project written in my freshman year back in 2013. A 3d maze made with a custom software renderer, implemented in Python and using no 3d libraries.
## Requirements
This python application requires python 2.7 and pygame. 
## Running
It is launched by running "python 3DMain.py" on Windows (and Linux) and "python2.7-32 3DMain.py" on
Mac OSX. 

The program will ask for an input file, which should be located in the same folder as the code is run from. There is a file called "test_scene.txt" in
the "code" folder which can be used to test the software.

After entering a valid filename a pygame window should open rendering a maze in which the user can traverse in using the arrow keys of the keyboard.
